            A basic OpenGL Renderer written in C++. Currently, it is hosted on
            Github at https://github.com/sps1112/opengl-project. The work done
            on the renderer includes:- A basic primitive system to easily render
            primitives like Cube and Rects. The file reader is custom and the
            custom file extensions similar to .obj format. Blinn-Phong Shading
            with Gamma Correction implemented. Updated from previous Phong
            Shading. The Renderer is set up to later include PBR. A movable
            Camera system with Orthographic and Perspective cameras with easily
            configurable properties. Integrating ASSIMP to help with loading
            pre-made 3D Assets. Also tweak the integration to Render Blender
            Scenes exported as .obj files. A Shader and Light Class to set up
            multiple lights in a Scene. The lights are all dynamic with easily
            accessible properties. This helps in easily debugging lighting
            effects in shaders. GUI with ImGui to debug the scene and alter the
            properties of Scene Objects and Renderer. The GUI is abstracted to
            instantiate multiple windows with configurable properties. Rendering
            to a Framebuffer. This helps in implementing post-processing effects
            to the final render. Third-Party libraries that are used in the
            project include GLFW, GLM, Assimp, ImGui. The current plan for the
            renderer is to:- Implement a Scene System with UI to easily create
            new Scenes Add Objects to that scene in the form of 2D objects, 3D
            objects, Camera and Lights. Edit Predefined properties of said
            objects such as color and World Position. These would help the user
            in creating their own scenes and easily debug effect on pre-defined
            template scenes. A basic OpenGL Renderer written in C++. Currently,
