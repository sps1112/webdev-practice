                A basic OpenGL Renderer written in C++.

                Currently, it is hosted on
                Github at https://github.com/sps1112/opengl-project.

                The work done on
                the renderer includes:-
                A basic primitive system to easily render primitives like Cube and Rects. The file reader is custom and
                the
                custom file extensions similar to .obj format.
                Blinn-Phong Shading with Gamma Correction implemented. Updated from previous Phong
                Shading. The Renderer is set up to later include PBR.
                A movable Camera
                system with Orthographic and Perspective cameras with easily
                configurable properties. Integrating ASSIMP to help with loading
                pre-made 3D Assets. Also tweak the integration to Render Blender
                Scenes exported as .obj files. A Shader and Light Class to set up
                multiple lights in a Scene. The lights are all dynamic with easily
                accessible properties. This helps in easily debugging lighting effects
                in shaders. GUI with ImGui to debug the scene and alter the properties
                of Scene Objects and Renderer. The GUI is abstracted to instantiate
                multiple windows with configurable properties. Rendering to a
                Framebuffer. This helps in implementing post-processing effects to the
                final render. Third-Party libraries that are used in the project
                include GLFW, GLM, Assimp, ImGui. The current plan for the renderer is
                to:- Implement a Scene System with UI to easily create new Scenes Add
                Objects to that scene in the form of 2D objects, 3D objects, Camera
                and Lights. Edit Predefined properties of said objects such as color
                and World Position. These would help the user in creating their own
                scenes and easily debug effect on pre-defined template scenes.
